*it’s really about the time and energy that the strings had with the artist. so many songs are written and played in the lifetime the strings had on their instrument. so much of the artist's life and emotion have come through the strings. it’s really cool to transform the energy of those life experiences into something new all-together, while still honoring that these things come from a highly emotive, expressive, creative past.*
