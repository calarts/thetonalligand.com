  description: 
    - Cells perform complex computations on combinations of BMP ligands
    - A mathematical model shows how computations arise from receptor-ligand promiscuity
    - A single cell type can perform different computations on different ligand pairs
    - Changes in receptor profiles can reprogram the computations
