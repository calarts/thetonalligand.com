#### We have developed a tonal framework for musical improvisation based on new research in cell communication. We transcoded the reception of molecular signals into music to capture the character of cellular interactions. We hope to suggest new avenues of scientific research through improvisation.

This site documents our process of creating music inspired by new research in cellular communication. The [**> presentation**](/presentation/) section replicated the deck shown at the Museum of Modern Art in June of 2018. [**> Exhibit: affinities**](/affinities/) presents the kinds of music generated by this approach. The [**> research**](/research/) page summarizes the paper from the [**> Elowitz Lab**](http://www.elowitz.caltech.edu) at Caltech that inspired this work. The [**> team**](/team/) page provides biographies for the musicians. Please [> Contact](/contact/) us for more information.
