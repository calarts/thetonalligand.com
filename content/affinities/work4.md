A ligand may be fully incompatible with receptor, and fail to bind with either of the two sections.

Here, Sid and Greta will again play the two prongs of the receptor, using the same two notes as before, and again playing in rhythmic unison. (Demonstrate perfect 5th again.) Nick, Chris, and John are again playing ligands, represented by the same notes as before. The difference is that, this time, one of the ligands with an incompatible, dissonant non-chord tone will attempt to bind with the receptor, and neither receptor part sounds harmonious with this rogue ligand. In this case, the ligand attempting to bind is John. (Demonstrate each receptor note with ligand one at a time, then all three together.) The other two ligands will continue to exist without interacting with the cell, and will not bind rhythmically to the receptor. DEMONSTRATE PART 1B
