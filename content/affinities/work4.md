A ligand may be fully incompatible with receptor, and fail to bind with either of the two sections.

## Examples of Intervals Used

To represent an incompatible binding, we used the same interval to represent the receptors, but this time a “2nd” between the receptor notes represents the ligand. This note sounds dissonant with each of the two receptor notes separately, producing a minor 2nd and a tritone:
