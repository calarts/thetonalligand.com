A ligand may only be compatible with the second of two receptor parts, while the other part remains incompatible with the ligand.

Sid and Greta are playing in rhythmic unison again as the two parts of the receptor, but this time their notes are different- they are 7 notes apart. (Sid and Greta demonstrate 7th). Nick, Chris, and John are again rhythmically erratic ligands wandering outside of the cell. This time, Chris will attempt to bind with the receptor by matching its rhythm. Because Chris’s note is a consonant with only one of the two receptor parts (Chris and Sid demonstrate major 3rd) and incompatible with the other receptor half (Chris and Greta demonstrate tritone), it results in an incomplete binding- a 7th chord, which isn’t “ugly” to hear, but not technically dissonant. Nick and John here are two non-binding, rhythmically independent ligands.
