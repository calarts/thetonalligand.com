A ligand may be fully compatible with a receptor, binding with both sections.

Sid and Greta will play the two parts of the receptor, represented by two different tones, each five notes apart (making an interval referred to as a perfect 5th.) Because they each represent one half of the single receptor, they will be playing a fixed rhythm together. (Sid and Greta demonstrate a few notes) .

Nick, Chris, and John all represent ligands, playing different individual tones in an erratic rhythm that isn’t in time with the receptors, and therefore not bound with them. (Nick, Chris, and John demonstrate?) Over time, Nick, who is playing a note compatible with the receptor chord, a possible “chord tone”, he will “bind” with the receptors by matching their rhythm and playing in harmony with them. His note is “compatible” because adding it produces a minor triad, what is referred to as “consonant” in music, or simply harmonious and easy to listen to. (Demonstrate minor triad)- but, because Chris and John are playing non-chord tones, which sound dissonant (or, uglier) with the receptor chord- (Chris and John play tones with Greta and Sid to demonstrate dissonance)- and in this case these other two ligands will not attempt to bind, instead remaining outside of the cell and continuing their erratic rhythms.  DEMONSTRATE PART 1A
