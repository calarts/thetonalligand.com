  description: We will simulate new research in cellular communication by transposing
    intercellular communication into music. Cells emit molecular signals called ligands
    to communicate with others nearby. Bonds between the ligands and receptors embedded
    in the cell's surface may generate behavioral changes depending on the quality
    of the bonds and the presence of complementary ligands. We will illustrate this
    communication with various musical concepts, such as the science of consonance
    and dissonance, rhythmic expression, and the majesty of jazz. By demonstrating
    this phenomenon using sound, we hope to simplify the learning process and provide
    new and exciting ways of understanding ligands on a surface level as well as suggest
    avenues for research by exploring scientific investigations as sound and music.
