#### In 2017 our Caltech colleagues identified multiplex molecular communications between cells. They found that the same signals may cause different responses depending on the cell's type. This research suggests new classes of biotherapies that send discordant signals to cancerous cells without affecting healthy cells nearby. 

---

##### There are two parts to this communication: receptor and ligand. Each receptor is a "dimer" -- a complex of two single proteins. The ligands are promiscuous: they try to bind with both parts of each receptor. Ligands may bind with either side of the dimer, both, or neither. The quality of the bond informs activation pathways within the cell.

##### This three-part system suggests rich tonal blends. Two musicians play each part of the receptor. They play tones five notes apart. The ligands play individual tones in an erratic rhythm that isn’t in time with the receptors. Successful binding is consonant and coordinates the ligand's rhythm with the receptors. 




## How Ligands Bind to Cell Receptors

![spectrum of affinities](/img/spectrum-of-affinities_white-sm.png)

A cell receptor consists of two parts, both of which must be compatible with a given ligand for a full binding.

## What are Consonance and Dissonance?
### In music, the relationship between two tones (an interval) is either consonant or dissonant. 
### Like ligands binding with cell receptors, they refer to the differing levels of compatibility between any two tones.

When an interval is consonant, it has a pleasant,  “finished” sounding quality. 
 
<BR />
 
When an interval is dissonant, it sounds uglier,  as though it needs to be “resolved” to something   consonant.

## Using Intervals to Represent Ligand Bindings

We use two tones (an interval) to represent the two parts of the cell receptor, and a seperate single tone to represent a ligand. The ligand tone will match the continuous rhythm of the receptor tones to represent a binding. Other ligand tones will be present, but will not attempt to bind to the receptor- they are playing separate, erratic rhythms.

## Examples of Intervals Used: Consonant

To represent a fully compatible binding, we used a “perfect 5th” interval for the two receptor parts, with the “3rd” between them representing the ligand. This makes a consonant “major triad”:

---

## Examples of Intervals Used: Dissonant

To represent an incompatible binding, we used the same interval to represent the receptors, but this time a “2nd” between the receptor notes represents the ligand. This note sounds dissonant with each of the two receptor notes separately, producing a minor 2nd and a tritone:

## Examples of Intervals Used: 

To represent a partially compatible binding, we used a “perfect 4th” interval (simply 4 notes apart instead of 5, as used previously) to represent the cell receptor. The two tones are B-flat and E-flat. 
 
There are two examples of partially compatible bindings. First, we inserted a D between the tones- this is consonant with one of the two receptor notes (the B-flat, producing a major 3rd) and dissonant with the other (the E-flat, producing a minor 2nd).

## Examples of Intervals Used

For the second example of a partially compatible binding, we inserted a different note between the same B-flat and E-flat. This new note, a C-flat, is consonant with the E-flat (producing a major 3rd) but dissonant with the B-flat (producing a minor 2nd.) The consonant and dissonant intervals are the same in each partially compatible binding, but the compatible receptor has changed.

## What Purpose Does a Ligand Binding Serve?

When multiple ligands bind to a cell’s receptors at the same time, they can bring about behavioral changes in the cell. We chose to show this with a pair of bindings, represented by chords, evolving into a chord progression (then, a full piece of music!) 
 
If a ligand is incompatible or only partially compatible with a certain receptor pair, the cell’s behavior will be unaffected. Thus, a cell will change the nature of its receptors to match the ligand attempting to bind. This is represented by the receptor tones changing to become consonant with the original ligand tone. 

---

## Steps Toward Music...

#### Receptor 1: Fully compatible binding (consonant intervals) 
#### Receptor 2: Incompatible binding (dissonant intervals) 
 
Receptor 2 changes its two tones to become consonant with the original ligand tone which attempted to bind to it. 
 
Once multiple receptors have achieved full compatibility, a larger and more complex consonant chord is achieved, which gives way to an improvisation- something spontaneous, just as a cell may spontaneously be able to change its behavioral abilities.

## Example I: Fully Compatible Binding

#### C and G = Cell Receptors  
#### E = Binding Ligand

## Example II: Incompatible Binding

#### C and G = Cell Receptors  
#### D-Flat = Binding Ligand

## Example III: Partially-Compatible Binding A

#### B-flat and E-flat: Cell Receptors 
#### D: Binding Ligand (consonant with B-flat, dissonant with E-flat)

## Example IV: Partially-Compatible Binding B

#### B-flat and E-flat: Cell Receptors 
#### C-flat: Binding Ligand (consonant with E-flat, dissonant with B-flat)

## Example V part I: Multiple Receptors and Ligands Binding at Once

#### Receptor I: Compatible Binding

#### Receptor II: Incompatible Binding which becomes compatible

## Example V part II: Resulting Cell Behavioral Change

The full chord produced by multiple compatible bindings occuring at once can spontaneously become a chord progression!
