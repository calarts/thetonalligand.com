description = "cells emit molecular signals called ligands to communicate with others nearby. bonds between the ligands and receptors embedded in the cell’s surface may generate behavioral changes depending on the quality of the bonds and the presence of complementary ligands. we will illustrate this communication with various musical concepts, such as the science of consonance and dissonance, rhythmic expression, and the majesty of jazz."

### We have developed a tonal framework for musical improvisation based on new research in cell communication. We transcoded the reception of molecular signals into music to capture the character of cellular interactions. We hope to suggest new avenues of scientific research through improvisation.

#### In 2017 our Caltech colleagues identified multiplex molecular communications between cells. They found that the same signals may cause different responses depending on the cell's type. This research suggests new classes of biotherapies that send discordant signals to cancerous cells without affecting healthy cells nearby. 

##### There are two parts to this communication: receptor and ligand. Each receptor is a "dimer" -- a complex of two single proteins. The ligands are promiscuous: they try to bind with both parts of each receptor. Ligands may bind with either side of the dimer, both, or neither. The quality of the bond informs activation pathways within the cell.

##### This three-part system suggests rich tonal blends. Two musicians play each part of the receptor. They play tones five notes apart. The ligands play individual tones in an erratic rhythm that isn’t in time with the receptors. Successful binding is consonant and coordinates the ligand's rhythm with the receptors.
