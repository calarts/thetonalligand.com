description = "cells emit molecular signals called ligands to communicate with others nearby. bonds between the ligands and receptors embedded in the cellâ€™s surface may generate behavioral changes depending on the quality of the bonds and the presence of complementary ligands. we will illustrate this communication with various musical concepts, such as the science of consonance and dissonance, rhythmic expression, and the majesty of jazz."
