Receptor 2 changes its two tones to become consonant with the original ligand tone which attempted to bind to it.   Once multiple receptors have achieved full compatibility, a larger and more complex consonant chord is achieved, which gives way to an improvisation- something spontaneous, just as a cell may spontaneously be able to change its behavioral abilities.
