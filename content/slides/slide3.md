A ligand may only be compatible with the second of two receptor parts, while the other part remains incompatible with the ligand.

## Examples of Intervals Used


For the second example of a partially compatible binding, we inserted a different note between the same B-flat and E-flat. This new note, a C-flat, is consonant with the E-flat (producing a major 3rd) but dissonant with the B-flat (producing a minor 2nd.) The consonant and dissonant intervals are the same in each partially compatible binding, but the compatible receptor has changed.
