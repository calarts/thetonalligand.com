description = "We use two tones (an interval) to represent the two parts of the cell receptor, and a seperate single tone to represent a ligand. "

The ligand tone will match the continuous rhythm of the receptor tones to represent a binding. Other ligand tones will be present, but will not attempt to bind to the receptor- they are playing separate, erratic rhythms.
