- In music, the relationship between two tones (an interval) is either consonant or dissonant. 
- Like ligands binding with cell receptors, they refer to the differing levels of compatibility between any two tones.

When an interval is consonant, it has a pleasant,  “finished” sounding quality.   

<BR /> 
 
When an interval is dissonant, it sounds uglier,  as though it needs to be “resolved” to something   consonant.
