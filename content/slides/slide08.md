We chose to show this with a pair of bindings, represented by chords, evolving into a chord progression (then, a full piece of music!)    If a ligand is incompatible or only partially compatible with a certain receptor pair, the cell’s behavior will be unaffected. Thus, a cell will change the nature of its receptors to match the ligand attempting to bind. This is represented by the receptor tones changing to become consonant with the original ligand tone.
