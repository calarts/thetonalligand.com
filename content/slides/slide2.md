A ligand may only be compatible with one of the two receptor parts, while the other part remains incompatible with the ligand.

#### In music, the relationship between two tones (an interval) is either consonant or dissonant. 
#### Like ligands binding with cell receptors, they refer to the differing levels of compatibility between any two tones.

 When an interval is consonant, it has a pleasant,  “finished” sounding quality.   <BR /> 
 
When an interval is dissonant, it sounds uglier,  as though it needs to be “resolved” to something   consonant.
