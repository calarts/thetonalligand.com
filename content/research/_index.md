title = "Combinatorial Signal Perception in the BMP Pathway"
+++

We will simulate new research in cellular communication by transposing intercellular communication into music. Cells emit molecular signals called ligands to communicate with others nearby. Bonds between the ligands and receptors embedded in the cell's surface may generate behavioral changes depending on the quality of the bonds and the presence of complementary ligands. We will illustrate this communication with various musical concepts, such as the science of consonance and dissonance, rhythmic expression, and the majesty of jazz.

### Abstract
By harnessing promiscuous receptor-ligand interactions in the BMP pathway, a single cell can perform different computations, depending on which combinations of receptors and ligands are present.

### Highlights
- Cells perform complex computations on combinations of BMP ligands
- A mathematical model shows how computations arise from receptor-ligand promiscuity
- A single cell type can perform different computations on different ligand pairs
- Changes in receptor profiles can reprogram the computations
