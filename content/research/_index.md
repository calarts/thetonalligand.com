### Abstract
By harnessing promiscuous receptor-ligand interactions in the BMP pathway, a single cell can perform different computations, depending on which combinations of receptors and ligands are present.

### Highlights
- Cells perform complex computations on combinations of BMP ligands
- A mathematical model shows how computations arise from receptor-ligand promiscuity
- A single cell type can perform different computations on different ligand pairs
- Changes in receptor profiles can reprogram the computations.
